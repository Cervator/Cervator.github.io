# One more time

I've been meaning to start blogging about interesting technical topics for years now. Maybe with the ease of a nice [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/) and some [Atom](https://atom.io/) magic this will be the time that sticks :-)

In the near future I'm looking forward to writing about getting [Terasology](https://terasology.org) and its related project pieces rehosted on a shiny new [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster with [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) and various other automagic all running on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/). My latest job is smack in the middle of such tech and I should be able to spend time on it both for work and play.

For development I don't write much actual code these days, but aim to throw together some mashups involving [Trello](https://trello.com), [GitHub](https://developer.github.com/), and various other things to automate, like better organizing volunteers and mentors. [GSOC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and [GCI](https://codein.withgoogle.com/) are awesome but a lot of work - need to make staying on top of it all more efficient!
